Geo4LibCamp 2021 is a virutal hands-on meeting to bring together those building repository services for geospatial data. The main focus is to share best-practices, solve common problems, and address technical issues with integrating geospatial data into a repository and associated services. For the purposes of the camp, we broadly define geospatial data from scanned maps and aerial photography to highly structured shapefiles. The camp is structured as an unconference with suggested topics coming from the participants in advance, but we will also have a few prepared sessions.

Geo4LibCamp 2021 will be held virtually the week of February 8, 2021.

Monday, February 8, 2021 - 9 AM - 1 PM ET
